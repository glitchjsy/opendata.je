# Authentication
To access higher rate limits and receive important updates about the API, we recommend creating an account and generating an API key.

Visit the [Account page](/account), sign in and create a new API key.

Don’t have an account yet? Registration is currently closed. To request access, please get in touch via [email](mailto:luke@glitch.je) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/lukejwyatt).

When making requests, you can provide your API key using the `auth` query parameter (not recommended) or, preferably, the `x-api-key` header.
